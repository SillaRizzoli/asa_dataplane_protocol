Disclaimer: this program is not sponsored or endorsed by Cisco Systems in
any way. It's just a little script that I wrote for my own convenience and
it's released in the hope that it will be useful and that people will
improve it for the benefit of everyone. I'm pretty sure that it's full of
bugs and badly written code so, if you decide to use it, it's entirely at
your own risk.

How to install: copy the asa_dataplane.lua file to the plugins directory for
your version of wireshark; for example, on Windows and for wireshark version
1.10 the directory is C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\1.10.0

How to use: after installing the file, launch wireshark and open a .pcap
file captured on a Cisco ASA firewall with the asa_dataplane capture command
switch.
